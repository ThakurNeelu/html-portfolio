<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> 
 
<h2>1: Introduction:</h2>
My name is Neelu Thakur, and I hail from the enchanting city of Jabalpur, located in the heart of Madhya Pradesh, India. I am blessed to be a mother to two wonderful children—a 10-year-old daughter and a 6-year-old son—who bring boundless joy into my life each day. Though my journey began as a veterinarian and veterinary surgeon, ten years ago, I transitioned to the realm of academia. Pursuing my passion for understanding the intricate world of microbiology, I earned a Master's degree from South Dakota State University. Presently, I find myself engaged as a full-time faculty member at the University of Dayton, where I have the privilege of imparting knowledge through teaching microbiology labs

<h2>2: Professional Transition and Aspirationso:</h2>
<p>
  Although I'm content with my work in academia, I have a strong longing to expand my horizons. I dream of venturing into the field of software engineering, aiming to become a full-stack developer. This shift isn't just about my career; it's also a journey of personal growth and discovery. I want to use the varied skills I've gained from my years as a vet and in academia to succeed in this new field. With dedication and determination, I'm determined to learn all I can and make a positive impact in the world of technology.

<h2>3: Personal Passions and Values:</h2>
<p>
  Outside of my professional pursuits, I find fulfillment in various personal interests. Art, especially the intricate patterns of mandala design and the traditional art of henna, brings me immense joy and creativity. Dancing is another passion of mine, allowing me to express myself freely and joyously. Cooking is a source of pleasure for me—I love preparing delicious meals for my loved ones. Gardening, on the other hand, serves as both a therapeutic escape and a way to grow fresh vegetables and colorful flowers. Most importantly, I value sincerity and authenticity, preferring genuine connections over emotional drama. Being true to oneself is something I strongly believe in.
